I am a student researcher currently working as a full-stack Ruby developer.
My focus are web-based applications and research related applications related to biology/bioinformatics/semantic web.
This page is a collection of stuff I do and did.
In my spare time I enjoy trying out software libraries, competing in sports and playing video games.
